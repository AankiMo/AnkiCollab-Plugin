## Handling Suggestions

As a maintainer, you are responsible for approving or denying changes. There are multiple types, and we'll cover them all here.

### Content Changes ‚Äî New Cards, Tags, Formatting, etc.

All the different possible changes are handled the same way. Someone (or you) may submit a change ‚Äî fixing typos, updating content, formatting, or something else. You'll go to the All Reviews page on AnkiCollab and approve or deny them.

Let's use a sample card from a trivia deck.

![A flashcard with the front saying "World's Tallest Building" and the back saying "Lotte World Tower."](https://i.imgur.com/JxQGgx5.png)

While Lotte World Tower is definitely tall, it's not the tallest ‚Äî that would be Burj Khalifa. A good contribute corrects the card and suggests the change.

Navigate to [AnkiCollab.com](https://ankicollab.com/) and click All Reviews to see suggestions for your published decks.

From here, we see we have a suggestion involving a content error.

![The All Reviews page on AnkiCollab.com](https://i.imgur.com/hWeodp4.png)

When you click on the card, you'll see what the field had before and after the change. If you'd like to see the rest of the fields for context, click Go To Full Review.

![A blue arrow pointing to the Go To Full Review button.](https://i.imgur.com/hz45hrb.png)

Here, the rest of the fields are shown.

From here, or the previous page, simply click the green check mark for suggestions you want to keep or the red X to reject them. After that, you're good to go!
