# Getting Started - Maintainer

*description*

## Installing the Addon

Before you start, make sure you are using the latest version of Anki found [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). If you've never used Anki before, there is a great [Getting Started](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html) guide in the Anki manual.

Every add-on in the Anki ecosystem is installed using an **add-on code**. AnkiCollab's code is `1957538407`.

If you ever lose this code, you can always find it on [AnkiCollab add-on page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1957538407). Scroll down a bit and you'll find it in a little box.

Inside of Anki, go Tools ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Get Add-ons. From here, a box should pop up where you can enter the code.

Click OK and relaunch Anki to finish the installation.

You can confirm that the installation was successful by checking the toolbar for AnkiCollab.
