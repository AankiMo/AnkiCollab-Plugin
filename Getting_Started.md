# Getting Started

## Description

AnkiCollab is an open-source, free, collaboration tool to create and share Anki decks. If you ever wanted to split up the work of making cards, AnkiCollab offers a platform to make this possible.

## Installing the Addon

Before you start, make sure you are using the latest version of Anki found [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). If you've never used Anki before, there is a great [Getting Started](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html) guide in the Anki manual.

Every add-on in the Anki ecosystem is installed using an **add-on code**. AnkiCollab's code is `1957538407`.

If you ever lose this code, you can always find it on [AnkiCollab add-on page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1957538407). Scroll down a bit and you'll find it in a little box.

Inside of Anki, go Tools ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Get Add-ons. From here, a box should pop up where you can enter the code.

Click OK and relaunch Anki to finish the installation.

You can confirm that the installation was successful by checking the toolbar for AnkiCollab.

## Subscribing to a Deck

If you don't want to maintain or publish decks, you **do not** need an account. All you need is the deck's **subscription key**.

The key will be a series of words separated by dashes. Example:

```txt
pip-item-hawaii-skylark-network-rugby
```

### Getting a Key

If you know a deck's maintainer, they can give you the subscription key to paste into AnkiCollab.
If you know the deck's name, but don't know the key, go to [AnkiCollab.com/Decks](https://www.ankicollab.com/decks).
On the right, you'll find a search box to help locate the deck.

Click on the deck and the subscription key will be on the top. Copy it.

## Suggesting a Change

Not every Anki deck will be perfect ‚Äî some might have typos, content errors, strange formatting, or other issues. There might even be some errors in this very document that will get changed in the future!

One huge strength of AnkiCollab is the ability to let the maintainer know that there might be an issue with a deck.

Let's say you subscribe to a deck and find this card:

![An Anki card in the editor. The front reads "Biggest Animal in the World" and the back reads "Elephant."](https://i.imgur.com/wbKuRPj.png)

Sure, elephants are big, but you *know* the biggest animal in the world is *actually* a Blue Whale.

After double-checking that you're correct, change the word Elephant to Blue Whale in the same manner you would edit a normal card.

Once you've edited the card, click the AnkiCollab button.

![A blue arrow pointing to the AnkiCollab button in the Anki editor window.](https://i.imgur.com/dE9uEOW.png)

A small window will pop up and ask you to choose a rationale for making this change.

![A small pop up window with a dropdown box of various reasons for suggesting a change.](https://i.imgur.com/OhLwRH4.png)

In our case, let's choose Content Error. Next, click OK.

You've now submitted your first change!

From the maintainer's point of view, they'll see a window like this:

![On the AnkiCollab website showing the maintainer's options for reviewing suggestions.](https://i.imgur.com/aZBo31A.png)

This page tells the maintainer what exactly was changed and why.

From here, they can approve or reject your suggestion. If approved, everyone subscribed to this deck will receive an update with your change.

You are now ready to go into the AnkiCollab world and improve decks! üëç
