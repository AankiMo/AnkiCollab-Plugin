# Getting Started - Subscriber

If you don't want to maintain or publish decks, you **do not** need an account. All you need is the deck's **subscription key**.

The key will be a series of words separated by dashes. Example:

```txt
pip-item-hawaii-skylark-network-rugby
```

### Getting a Key

If you know a deck's maintainer, they can give you the subscription key to paste into AnkiCollab.
If you know the deck's name, but don't know the key, go to [AnkiCollab.com/Decks](https://www.ankicollab.com/decks).
On the right, you'll find a search box to help locate the deck.

Click on the deck and the subscription key will be on the top. Copy it.

There will be a confirmation and you can now close this window.

The deck may not show up immediately! If you don't see the deck, click the Deck button at the top of the main Anki page to refresh the view.

## Suggesting a Change

### Editing Card Content

Not every Anki deck will be perfect ‚Äî some might have typos, content errors, strange formatting, or other issues. There might even be some errors in this very document that will get changed in the future!

One huge strength of AnkiCollab is the ability to let the maintainer know that there might be an issue with a deck.

Let's say you subscribe to a deck and find this card:

![An Anki card in the editor. The front reads "Biggest Animal in the World" and the back reads "Elephant."](https://i.imgur.com/wbKuRPj.png)

Sure, elephants are big, but you *know* the biggest animal in the world is *actually* a Blue Whale.

After double-checking that you're correct, change the word Elephant to Blue Whale in the same manner you would edit a normal card.

Once you've edited the card, click the AnkiCollab button.

![A blue arrow pointing to the AnkiCollab button in the Anki editor window.](https://i.imgur.com/dE9uEOW.png)

A small window will pop up and ask you to choose a rationale for making this change.

![A small pop up window with a dropdown box of various reasons for suggesting a change.](https://i.imgur.com/OhLwRH4.png)

In our case, let's choose Content Error. Next, click OK.

You've now submitted your first change!

From the maintainer's point of view, they'll see a window like this:

![On the AnkiCollab website showing the maintainer's options for reviewing suggestions.](https://i.imgur.com/aZBo31A.png)

This page tells the maintainer what exactly was changed and why.

From here, they can approve or reject your suggestion. If approved, everyone subscribed to this deck will receive an update with your change.

You are now ready to go into the AnkiCollab world and improve decks! üëç
