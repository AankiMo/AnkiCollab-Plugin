## Introduction

AnkiCollab is an open-source, free, collaboration tool to create and share Anki decks. New workflows and projects are possible with collaboration. Some possible opportunities:

- Split up the work of making cards!
  - Person A makes cards for chapter 1, person B makes cards for chapter 2, person C makes cards for chapter 3.
- Professional Revisions
  - Let's say you and your friends make a deck for your Spanish class. After it's done, you can get a native speaker (or even your teacher!) to go through all your cards and make corrections. After the corrections are accepted, everyone receives a polished deck!

## Getting Started Guides

We have two separate Getting Started guides for [maintainers](https://github.com/CravingCrates/AnkiCollab-Plugin/blob/main/getting_started_maintainer.md) and [subscribers](https://github.com/CravingCrates/AnkiCollab-Plugin/blob/main/getting_started_subscriber.md). Check out our [FAQ](https://github.com/CravingCrates/AnkiCollab-Plugin/blob/main/faq.md) for extra help.

## Installing the Addon

[AnkiCollab Add-on Page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1957538407)

Before you start, make sure you are using the latest version of Anki found [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). If you've never used Anki before, there is a great [Getting Started](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html) guide in the Anki manual.

Every add-on in the Anki ecosystem is installed using an **add-on code**. AnkiCollab's code is `1957538407`.

If you ever lose this code, you can always find it on [AnkiCollab add-on page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1957538407). Scroll down a bit and you'll find it in a little box.

Inside of Anki, go Tools ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Get Add-ons. From here, a box should pop up where you can enter the code.
