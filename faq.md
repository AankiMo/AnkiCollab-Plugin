<summary><b>Does AnkiCollab handle multiple profiles?</b></summary>
AnkiCollab does not currently respect separate Anki profiles. If you subscribe to a deck on one profile, then switch to another, it will redownload the fresh deck. A workaround for this is to disable the addon. <code>Tools → Add-ons → Select AnkiCollab → Toggle Enabled</code>

<summary><b>Does media get stored on AnkiCollab? How do subscribers get deck media?</b></summary>
AnkiCollab does not upload media (images, audio, etc.) when publishing a deck or suggesting changes. If a deck has media, the maintainer should have a link available for you to download.

<summary><b>How are deck settings handled?</b></summary>
Deck settings — learning steps, new card limits, maximum interval, etc. — are not uploaded when publishing a deck. When a subscriber downloads a deck, their default deck options are assigned. If you want a subscriber to use specific settings, make a note of them in the deck description.

<summary><b>Can I suggest a card to be deleted?</b></summary>
Currently, there is no way to delete individual cards from a deck uploaded to <a href="https://ankicollab.com/decks">AnkiCollab.com/Decks</a>. As a workaround, suggest a tag like <code>#!DELETE</code> indicating that you want a card deleted.
