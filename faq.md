## General

<summary><b>Does AnkiCollab handle multiple profiles?</b></summary>
AnkiCollab does not currently respect separate Anki profiles. If you subscribe to a deck on one profile, then switch to another, it will redownload the fresh deck. A workaround for this is to disable the addon. <code>Tools → Add-ons → Select AnkiCollab → Toggle Enabled</code>

<summary><b>Does media get stored on AnkiCollab? How do subscribers get deck media?</b></summary>
AnkiCollab does not upload media (images, audio, etc.) when publishing a deck or suggesting changes. If a deck has media, the maintainer should have a link available for you to download.

<summary><b>How are deck settings handled?</b></summary>
Deck settings — learning steps, new card limits, maximum interval, etc. — are not uploaded when publishing a deck. When a subscriber downloads a deck, their default deck options are assigned. If you want a subscriber to use specific settings, make a note of them in the deck description.

<summary><b>I changed the name of my deck/subdeck locally and now I get the error "No local deck ID"</b></summary>
Deck names should correlate exactly to the name that is on AnkiCollab. Currently there is no way to change your local deck name and continue publishing/receiving changes. Watch out for future changes though ;)

<summary><b>Can I suggest a card to be deleted?</b></summary>
Currently, there is no way to delete individual cards from a deck uploaded to <a href="https://ankicollab.com/decks">AnkiCollab.com/Decks</a>. As a workaround, suggest a tag like <code>#!DELETE</code> indicating that you want a card deleted.

  <summary><b>How do I change the deck name on Ankicollab?</b></summary>
  The only way to do that currently is by messaging the Discord group with your request here: https://discord.com/invite/9x4DRxzqwM 
  Keep in mind that when you change the deck name on AnkiCollab, you will also have to change your deck name locally. All your subscribers must also change their deck name locally to recieve changes.
